# PostgreSQL service

Using the Postgres service, via the direct connection string, from different programming languages

## Overview

Xata is a global multi-tenant system, composed of **cells**, each living in a region. At the high level, one Xata **cell** implements the following architecture:

- The data is stored in PostgreSQL, which is considered the source of truth.
- The PostgreSQL logical replication events are written in a Kafka queue, from where they can be read by multiple consumers.
- One of these consumers indexes the data into Elasticsearch.
- The Xata API layer offers a RESTful API offering both the functionality of the relational database (PostgreSQL) with the advanced search and analytics from the search engine/columnar store (Elasticsearch).
- On top of this API, Xata has client SDKs and a web interface.

While the above architecture is a very common one in the industry, it hasn’t been —until now— productized in a service, which means a lot of teams were forced to either implement something similar to the above or live with reduced functionality.

## Going global

As we’ve seen above, we call the combination of PostgreSQL + Elasticsearch and the associated services a “cell”. The cells are grouped into regions and form our **data plane**.
