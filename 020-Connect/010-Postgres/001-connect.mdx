This page shows you how to connect to Postgres, by explaining how a connection string is built, the different parameters and examples to connect via [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html).

## Connection string

The connection string to connect to Postgres is constructed the following:

```
postgresql://[User]:[Password]@[Host]:[Port]/[Database]
```

The following conversion table illustrates how the connection string parameters are mapped to Xata.

| Postgres | Xata                       | Example                 |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| User     | Workspace Id               | `ws1234`                |
| Password | API Key                    | `xau_apikey123456`      |
| Host     | Region plus `.sql.xata.sh` | `us-east-1.sql.xata.sh` |
| Port     | `5432` or empty            | `5432`                  |
| Database | Database and branch name   | `Games:main`            |

With the example values from above, the connection string to connect to our database `Games` on branch `main` is constructed as:

```
postgresql://ws1234:xau_apikey123456@us-east-1.sql.xata.sh:5432/Games:main
```

The connection strings for the HTTP access and for the Postgres wire protocol are shown to you when you create a new database, afterwards you can always navigate to the database settings to see the URL construction.

To create a new API key, or manage your existing ones, you need to open your [account settings](https://app.xata.io/settings).

Using psql to connect to your database, based off the previously constructed connection string with the example values:

```bash
psql "postgresql://ws1234:xau_apikey123456@us-east-1.sql.xata.sh:5432/Games:main"

Games:main=>
```
