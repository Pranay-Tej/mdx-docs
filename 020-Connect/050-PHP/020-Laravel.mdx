To connect your Laravel application to Xata, you need to adjust the database connection in the .env file as follows:

```bash title=".env"
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=<REGION>.sql.xata.sh
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=<DATABASE>:<BRANCH>
DB_USERNAME=<WORKSPACE_ID>
DB_PASSWORD=<API_KEY>
```

Please replace the parameters as indicated on the [connect to Postgres](/docs/postgres) page.

Please be aware that Laravel migrations are not fully supported on shared-clusters, as the statement `CREATE TYPE` is not allowed.
For full support, you must use a dedicated cluster, see [supported statements](/docs/postgres/connect#supported-statements) for a complete breakdown.

## Known issues

- `php artisan schema:dump` will not work as it tries to reset the `search_path` which is an [unsupported operation](/docs/postgres#unsupported-statements-and-functions) in Xata. Please follow the [export instructions](/docs/postgres#export) to dump a schema with pg_dump.
