Xata provides you multiple options to interact with your database, the most powerful is the dedicated cluster.
It is a Postgres instance, that only belongs to you, so you get all the power of Postgres with Xata features on top.

Dedicated cluster is available in the [Pro plan](/docs/concepts/pricing#pro-plan).

## Supported versions

At the moment Xata supports the following Postgres versions:

- 15.4
- 15.5
- 14.10
- 14.9

As we working to promoted dedicated clusters to generaly available (GA), we will add more versions.
Another functionality we are working on is to provide you control over the maintenance windows and the ability upgrade a version yourself.
