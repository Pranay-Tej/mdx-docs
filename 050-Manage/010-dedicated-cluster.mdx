Xata provides you multiple options to interact with your database, the most powerful is the dedicated cluster.
It is a Postgres instance, that only belongs to you, so you get all the power of Postgres with Xata features on top.

Dedicated cluster is available in the [Pro plan](docs/concepts/pricing#pro-plan).
