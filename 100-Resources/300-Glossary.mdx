## A

ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability): a set of properties that guarantee database transactions are processed reliably. ACID is crucial for ensuring the integrity of data within a database.

API (application programming interface): a set of rules and specifications that software applications can follow to communicate with each other. APIs play a critical role in accessing database services over the web.

Aggregate functions: functions that perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. Common examples include SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), and MIN().

## B

Backup: the process of copying and archiving database data to ensure data recovery in case of system failure, data corruption, or any other types of data loss.
Base table: the underlying table in a database that stores raw data. It is the physical representation of the table structure and data.

## C

CDN (content delivery network): a distributed network of servers that work together to deliver internet content rapidly by caching content in multiple locations around the world. Though not a database concept per se, CDNs often interact closely with databases in web applications.
CRUD (create, read, update, delete): the four basic operations of persistent storage. Also known as the basic functions of a database.
Concurrency: the ability of a database to allow multiple users to affect multiple transactions. This is crucial for the efficiency and performance of databases.

## D

Database: a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways. Databases are used to store, retrieve, add, update, and delete data.
Data integrity: the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data stored in a database. Data integrity is maintained through constraints, cascades, and other database mechanisms.
DDL (data definition language): a subset of SQL used to define or modify database structures, including tables, schemas, indexes, and more.

## E

ERD (entity-relationship diagram): a visual representation of different data using symbols such as rectangles (entities), ovals (attributes), and diamonds (relationships) to represent relationships among entities in a database.

## F

Foreign key: a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. It is used to establish and enforce a link between the data in two tables.
